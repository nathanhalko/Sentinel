29086373,Hank_Thompson,1,As we like to say in Tiny Penis Club  life is all about the little things. RT @johniadarola: Only in America do we brag about our "accurately delivered" ONE MILE BLAST RADIUS BOMBS. That knocking noise you hear is Brian Williams's boner banging against the desk after seeing today's beautiful bomb. We gave a con man the United States military. @MrStephenPike Sounds like perfection. I'll give it a look. @MrStephenPike That's quite easy to do. @MrStephenPike I haven't. I'll give it a look  tho  and see if I approve. My therapist  a Trump supporter  thinks I'm lying about being depressed. She keeps shouting  "Fake blues!" The warmer it becomes  the sooner we get our first photos of the President shirtless  as is tradition. Honestly  tanning is the easiest way to lose weight. If you really loved America and its mighty military  you'd paint your Easter eggs in camouflage.  *sits back and waits for chaos to ensue* Why do proofreading skills improve 1000% the moment you hit send? @AndyRichter Sometimes when I answer I drop my own headset and Cindy and I have a good laugh about it. Then I buy timeshares. You could correct Trump on anything: ... heading to Iraq. The Shire. Heading to the Shire. ... ate chocolate cake. Kittens. We ate kittens. 01/21/2021: "... your next President of the United States  Most Beautiful Piece of Chocolate Cake." President MBPOCC: Bow before me! Bow! Pepsi: Hold my Pepsi. United: Hold my passenger. Spicer: Hold my hand  Hitler. Spicer gonna get an ass-reaming from the big boss over costing him precious votes among the pro-Hitler crowd. @kristincliff It'll never end. They'll always have more horrible insanity to torment us with. I wish my car ran on anxiety. Pretty sure there's one of these flowing underneath all of America. https://t.co/EzDHvV2LXZ @kristincliff I'm afraid to blink.

2985092002,faacctt,1,People will hate you  rate you  break you  and shake you. How strong you stand is what makes you. Sometimes those who don't socialize much aren't actually anti-social  they just have no tolerance for drama and fake people. I think one of the greatest feelings in the world is when someone openly tells you how much you mean to them. stuff like that is so rare. Everyone has three lives: a public life  a private life  and a secret life Before you assume  try asking first. I admit  I really miss how things used to be. But I can also admit  that I've accepted the fact that things have changed. You were born to make mistakes  not to fake perfection. Trust someone who can see 3 things in you: the sorrow behind your smile  the love behind your anger and the reason behind your silence. An ugly personality can easily destroy a pretty face. Nothing is permanent. Especially people. Don't have your hopes high  friends become strangers  lovers become friends. And people leave. Fake friends are no different than shadows  they stick around during your brightest moments  but disappear during your darkest hours. I don‚Äôt think people understand how stressful it is to explain what‚Äôs going on in your head when you don‚Äôt even understand it yourself. Success is no accident. It is hard work  perseverance  learning  studying  sacrifice and most of all  love of what you are doing. Psychology says - no matter how angry you get  you always end up forgiving the people you love. If my daughter doesn't grow up thinking that I'm her best friend & that she can come to me for everything  then I have failed in life. Sometimes you just need to step outside  get some fresh air  clear your head  and remind yourself of who you are and where you want to be. The world is going to judge you  no matter what you do. So live your life the way you want to. It's funny how you can do nice things for people all the time  and they never notice. But once you make one mistake  it's never forgotten. Never pursue a career because others want you to. You'll be the one spending half your life at that job. Pursue your passion. Just because I tweet something doesn't mean it's relevant to my current situation. My tweets are a reflection of my thoughts  not my life

Hand lashing labour will be required about three kibbles before the end of the cleaning cycle and the "blow over" will commence. The serious damages did not allow repairing for further employments. These would be transported offshore ons a This is in fact now a common approach in Norway. - shaft sinking methods in underground mining Once again  air boosters were used to assist pumping.- shaft sinking for underground mine construction Extreme local gradients and stresses may result in deformation if the filling is rapid. (6'/cu.yd.) and explosives consumption was 1.6kg/cu.m. - sinking mine shafts in underground ore extraction If the branches A and B are steep and close together  the system will be very sensitive with respect to imperfections (Fig. Another 900m 3 will eventually be placed completing a total length of 40.1m. The guides are supported by brackets bolted to the concrete on one end wall and the 8 inch by 8 inch timber dividers. Despite these difficulties  the contract had its successes  particularly in the area of shaft sinking. The lead time on steel-lining delivery is long and the consequences of an underestimated leakage is therefore considerable. Ease of use of the loose detonators and the simplicity of threading the toroid into the circuit. 20-30 tons (22-33 short tons) thrust The max. Code of practice for special circumstances. -  shaft sinkers designing and constructing underground mines Exact verticality and alignment is achieved by installing with reference to a template and two dedicated plumb wires. Furthermore  flocculation of the cuttings is encouraged which avoids an extended separation time of cuttings in the mud pit. DIN 18800  Teil 2: Stahlbauten Stabilitatsfalle. #ShaftSinking in mining

3247113450,interfluidibot,1,But it could and should replace mean-tested welfare programs like TANF and food stamps. But suppose the bank has precisely one penny of equity against a hundred dollars of assets. We don‚Äôt vote for the same reason we buy toothpaste   satisfying some personal want when the benefit outweighs the cost of doing so. Controversies surrounding the scope of government should be distinguished from discussions of the scale of the transfer state. The bit I‚Äôve quoted is perhaps the least interesting part of the essay. I‚Äôd like to propose a financial innovation that I think would actually be good (besides the ATM). The case for marriage promotion begins with some perfectly real correlations. His analysis is right on  but perhaps it doesn‚Äôt go far enough. I think it‚Äôs bizarre that he doesn‚Äôt bother to see if his argument is actually true. Oppression might well produce a culture of failure. As the economy grows  agents become rich and content and cease contributing to growth. Bears who were right deserve to get paid just as much as bulls who were right  and justice delayed is justice denied for shorts. But ‚Äúa great deal‚Äù does not mean unlimited  and tolerance does not imply unconditional cheerleading. Yes  it can. At any given time  some groups of people are repaying debt and others are taking it on. People on the political right would mostly celebrate the statement. There has been so much talk of catastrophic consequences if we do not support this bail-out. Not that there‚Äôs much the poor can do about it. Reposted with gillies‚Äô permission. gillies writes at https://t.co/A7Gz8XnRk3  where a wealth of material awaits. Here is his case (in a PDF he describes as ‚Äúheroically constructed by Sigve Indregard‚Äù). Often even people in her ‚Äúgood‚Äù group don‚Äôt work out  and each failed hire is an emotionally and financially costly event for the firm. If it is taught without that caveat (and others  see DeLong‚Äôs piece)  the theory is not defensible intellectually or morally.

A relationship isn't meant to be smooth flowing. There will be troubles coming your way. But when they do  don't be afraid to face them.

The GOP has the votes. @ValentineShow  if Obama will commute Manning's sentence do you think a pardon for Hillary is far behind? @ValentineShow Bradley Manning can call himself whatever he likes. He's still a bitch. @RobSchneider is right. That's why he's catching so much butthurt from the lib media & the perpetually aggrieved.  https://t.co/N7qMouXPlB I think @repjohnlewis is right. It'd be nice to have an AG do their job for all. We haven't had one for 8 years.  https://t.co/fmrSkZEz6o Nice job keeping it civil. I hope his interview with the feds is fun. 1A doesn't cover advocating violence.  https://t.co/SnG0NBPqLe @rickandbubba  Funny that the groups who beat the drums about bullying are the ones threatening the inauguration. #HillaryforPrison ? Get real. Obama will pardon her. She'll never even be investigated. Trump vows ‚Äòinsurance for everybody‚Äô in Obamacare replacement plan.  This sounds familiar somehow.   https://t.co/2UjbFnW1TT

Strength is when you have so much to cry for but you prefer to smile instead. üí™üèæüí™üèæ Let your smile change the world but never let the world change your smile. Sometimes you have to lose the battle to win the war. When love is real  it finds a way. I'm strong because I know my weaknesses. I'm wise because I've been foolish. I laugh because I've known sadness. Sometimes it takes sadness to know happiness  noise to appreciate silence and absence to value presence. Everyone deserves second chances  but not for the same mistake. If you're lucky enough to get a second chance  do not waste it. üéØüéØüéØ You'll never live a happy life if you always care about what others think about you. The past is your lesson. The present is your gift. The future is your motivation. Stop being afraid of what could go wrong and think of what could go right. "The best revenge is massive success." ‚Äî Frank Sinatra

You DO NOT have to be a PROPHET to succeed in ministry! Use your influence to open doors for others! What is power if its hoarded to ones own drowning! Some people do not need prayers.

2218376174,sileaswarwick,0,Nothing is more attractive than seeing someone who lives entirely in the present moment. I understand. I just don't care. Music is actually more effective at battling depression than counseling is. I'm a teenager why does my back hurt I'm not 70 years old If you think it's "gay" to do nice things for a girl you're probably too immature for a relationship anyway. Confidence and success go hand in hand. Keep a piece of paper and pencil by your bed. Everyone always gets their best ideas at night! Male-looking robots are called Androids female-looking robots are called Gynoids. IMAGINE IF SIMON COWELL WAS YOUR DAD AND YOU WERE SINGING IN THE SHOWER AND HE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR AND SAID "IT'S A NO FROM ME". Short women have a healthy advantage over women taller in height. They also live longer. Soda has the same effect on tooth enamel as Meth and Crack cocaine. I get progressively uglier throughout the day There is a company that will turn your cremated ashes into a diamond which can be used by your loved ones. johanna mason literally said "fuck you" to president snow but he's like "oh shit katniss done made herself a bird" Tobacco smoke contains over 4 000 chemicals  including at least 50 of that cause  initiate or promote cancer. true embarrassment lies within your first email address. i've grown so unattached from people like i could move across the country and not give a shit about leaving anyone expect for like 3 people If I text a person in the same room as me  I stare at them till they get it. cause of death: too shy to call ambulance Stop scrolling  you need sleep ?

MB is much more valuable than a receiver @JumboHart Why would Pats trade for anything less than #11? If they want him they need to give up #11 if not we should keep him! @MikeReiss @brettmartel Pats would get number 11 because that is Saints original pick @KevinRDuffy oh yeah fair point. Even then tho  if they go lower on $$$ it would be weird if MB signed cuz he said he wants elite money. @KevinRDuffy if they wouldn't offer two similarly skilled corners that money  why would they give that $ AND give up 1st pick for MB @KevinRDuffy the reason why I think this wouldn't happen is cuz GB could have offered the contract MB wants to Gilmore or Bouye but didn't

Senyum tak selalu berarti seseorang bahagia. Kadang seseorang tersenyum hanya karena tak ingin menjelaskan kenapa hatinya terluka. Cinta itu ibarat bara api  dia menghangatkan hatimu jika diungkapkan dgn Tulus. Jika tidak  dia akan menghanguskanmu. Hidup tak bisa jadi lebih baik tanpa cinta  tapi cinta dengan cara yang salah membuat hidup jadi lebih buruk. Mungkin Aku lahir kedunia untuk mencintaimu  dan kau terlahir untuk aku cintai. Berada dipelukanmu itu mengajarkanku apa arti kenyamanan yang sempurna :) Sulit tuk ucapkan selamat tinggal pada dia yang kamu cinta  tapi lebih sulit lagi ketika kenangan bersamanya tak hilang begitu saja. Seseorang yang berarti  tak akan dengan mudah kamu miliki. Jika kamu sungguh mencintai  jangan pernah berhenti berusaha untuk hati. Seseorang memilih tuk sendiri  bukan karena takut tuk mencinta lagi  tapi karena takut terluka dengan alasan yang sama tuk kedua kali. Jangan pernah manfaatkan cinta. tak peduli betapa dia mencintaimu  suatu saat dia pasti akan lelah karena terus terluka Terkadang kamu takut terlalu dekat dgn seseorang  karena kamu tahu dia bisa pergi kapan saja  tak peduli betapa dekat kamu dan dia.
