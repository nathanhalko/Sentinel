523247729,francoliu21,1,@forevershinin @anthonymsg don’t blame him for chasing $  but fact is he played an integral part from the start in how this has fallen apart @kmart_li still blaming the security guys and not themselves. “we apologize that they did that” 🙄. pro tip- just apologize without caveats @anthonymsg I always wonder what would’ve happened if Woodson had started Copeland and not Kenyon against IND. Maybe ECF  no Bargnani trade… @jsports_ent Fans wanted Dolan to stop meddling with specific moves  not changing front office personnel. Firing Phil would be the latter @stockmarky @anthonymsg could have told Masai “I’m going to the Knicks no matter what so get what you can”. he would’ve still gotten his $ @stockmarky @anthonymsg for a guy who calls himself a chess player  he played that situation about as badly as he could have. @stockmarky @anthonymsg I think in his mind his presence on the team alone would make them a contender  but still short-sighted @AnthonyMSG He didn't want to be a knick badly enough to not make them trade all their assets to denver so he could make 100% of his max @morganwatkins26 @bettyaberlin funny how you didn’t “identify” all the good things he may have done in his life “for the public” @charliezegers @herring_nba unreal. Newspapers just can’t resist clickbait  even in a situation like this. SMH @albertbreer “further address and resolve” hopefully equals $8 figures for the poor guy who just wanted to go take care of his patients @ramonashelburne @Bucks He definitely doesn't lead all rookies in Fg% but yes he's had a good year @tomhaberstroh Did players get hurt this much in the 80s-90s? If not  could training regimens be responsible and not just lack of rest? @mikegrunwald Great line: “[Trump] believes in winners and losers  and his idea of a “win-win” is a deal where he wins twice.” @FisolaNYDN funny how two completely different injuries heal on completely different timelines. @Al_Iannazzone is your podcast on iTunes? @jadubin5 then “absence of Ron Artest” should be #1 seed @krisplashed stop eating bricks @fisolanydn you can say that without talking about specific players’ kids. LBJ is right to tell him to mind his own business. @haralabob everyone gets your macro point  but your example “n” is 1 team and 2 stars  and you left out Parker who is a corpse at 34.

29086373,Hank_Thompson,1,As we like to say in Tiny Penis Club  life is all about the little things. RT @johniadarola: Only in America do we brag about our "accurately delivered" ONE MILE BLAST RADIUS BOMBS. That knocking noise you hear is Brian Williams's boner banging against the desk after seeing today's beautiful bomb. We gave a con man the United States military. @MrStephenPike Sounds like perfection. I'll give it a look. @MrStephenPike That's quite easy to do. @MrStephenPike I haven't. I'll give it a look  tho  and see if I approve. My therapist  a Trump supporter  thinks I'm lying about being depressed. She keeps shouting  "Fake blues!" The warmer it becomes  the sooner we get our first photos of the President shirtless  as is tradition. Honestly  tanning is the easiest way to lose weight. If you really loved America and its mighty military  you'd paint your Easter eggs in camouflage.  *sits back and waits for chaos to ensue* Why do proofreading skills improve 1000% the moment you hit send? @AndyRichter Sometimes when I answer I drop my own headset and Cindy and I have a good laugh about it. Then I buy timeshares. You could correct Trump on anything: ... heading to Iraq. The Shire. Heading to the Shire. ... ate chocolate cake. Kittens. We ate kittens. 01/21/2021: "... your next President of the United States  Most Beautiful Piece of Chocolate Cake." President MBPOCC: Bow before me! Bow! Pepsi: Hold my Pepsi. United: Hold my passenger. Spicer: Hold my hand  Hitler. Spicer gonna get an ass-reaming from the big boss over costing him precious votes among the pro-Hitler crowd. @kristincliff It'll never end. They'll always have more horrible insanity to torment us with. I wish my car ran on anxiety. Pretty sure there's one of these flowing underneath all of America. https://t.co/EzDHvV2LXZ @kristincliff I'm afraid to blink.

2985092002,faacctt,1,People will hate you  rate you  break you  and shake you. How strong you stand is what makes you. Sometimes those who don't socialize much aren't actually anti-social  they just have no tolerance for drama and fake people. I think one of the greatest feelings in the world is when someone openly tells you how much you mean to them. stuff like that is so rare. Everyone has three lives: a public life  a private life  and a secret life Before you assume  try asking first. I admit  I really miss how things used to be. But I can also admit  that I've accepted the fact that things have changed. You were born to make mistakes  not to fake perfection. Trust someone who can see 3 things in you: the sorrow behind your smile  the love behind your anger and the reason behind your silence. An ugly personality can easily destroy a pretty face. Nothing is permanent. Especially people. Don't have your hopes high  friends become strangers  lovers become friends. And people leave. Fake friends are no different than shadows  they stick around during your brightest moments  but disappear during your darkest hours. I don’t think people understand how stressful it is to explain what’s going on in your head when you don’t even understand it yourself. Success is no accident. It is hard work  perseverance  learning  studying  sacrifice and most of all  love of what you are doing. Psychology says - no matter how angry you get  you always end up forgiving the people you love. If my daughter doesn't grow up thinking that I'm her best friend & that she can come to me for everything  then I have failed in life. Sometimes you just need to step outside  get some fresh air  clear your head  and remind yourself of who you are and where you want to be. The world is going to judge you  no matter what you do. So live your life the way you want to. It's funny how you can do nice things for people all the time  and they never notice. But once you make one mistake  it's never forgotten. Never pursue a career because others want you to. You'll be the one spending half your life at that job. Pursue your passion. Just because I tweet something doesn't mean it's relevant to my current situation. My tweets are a reflection of my thoughts  not my life

You're giving up too much. Ask a professional about your rights. #StudentDebtHotline @DebtCrisisOrg A6: Go to https://t.co/KXkgRSVajY for a list of your Fed loans. If your loan isn't there  it's a private loan. @DebtCrisisOrg Those with private student loans are at the mercy of the lender. It's pay or don't pay. Great options  eh? @genprogress But don't forget about the marriage penalty. Review pros and cons of each plan before deciding.

3247113450,interfluidibot,1,But it could and should replace mean-tested welfare programs like TANF and food stamps. But suppose the bank has precisely one penny of equity against a hundred dollars of assets. We don’t vote for the same reason we buy toothpaste   satisfying some personal want when the benefit outweighs the cost of doing so. Controversies surrounding the scope of government should be distinguished from discussions of the scale of the transfer state. The bit I’ve quoted is perhaps the least interesting part of the essay. I’d like to propose a financial innovation that I think would actually be good (besides the ATM). The case for marriage promotion begins with some perfectly real correlations. His analysis is right on  but perhaps it doesn’t go far enough. I think it’s bizarre that he doesn’t bother to see if his argument is actually true. Oppression might well produce a culture of failure. As the economy grows  agents become rich and content and cease contributing to growth. Bears who were right deserve to get paid just as much as bulls who were right  and justice delayed is justice denied for shorts. But “a great deal” does not mean unlimited  and tolerance does not imply unconditional cheerleading. Yes  it can. At any given time  some groups of people are repaying debt and others are taking it on. People on the political right would mostly celebrate the statement. There has been so much talk of catastrophic consequences if we do not support this bail-out. Not that there’s much the poor can do about it. Reposted with gillies’ permission. gillies writes at https://t.co/A7Gz8XnRk3  where a wealth of material awaits. Here is his case (in a PDF he describes as “heroically constructed by Sigve Indregard”). Often even people in her “good” group don’t work out  and each failed hire is an emotionally and financially costly event for the firm. If it is taught without that caveat (and others  see DeLong’s piece)  the theory is not defensible intellectually or morally.

4238472515,KaffirInfidel,0,@NotreDame snowflakes are uncomfortable with a @MikePenceVP visit? The real world is really going to suck for them. How embarrassing. @valentineshow Men playing women's sports? Didn't the East Germans do that? @valentineshow she's missed the point about conservatives. We do not want a replacement. At all. Of any kind. @rickandbubba maybe if the wymyn protesting the billboard had been a little more appreciative they'd still have a provider In their home. @ValentineShow it's ironic that the socialists in America are suddenly practicing McCarthyism and screaming about the Russians. @ValentineShow They don't like to talk about Xenu. @ValentineShow Irony: the people who act like Nazis and accuse other people of being Nazis are backed by a man who was a Nazi collaborater @TheRevAl @aldotcom From what seminary did the Reverend graduate and at what church does he preach? @ValentineShow Was it WMGC in Antioch that was running the obscene song on a loop? @ValentineShow after eight years of Obama the libs are suddenly worried about a president not following the Constitution? @ValentineShow  Obama kissed up to dictators & mullahs but suddenly libs have a problem was Trump wanting to improve relations with Russia? @ValentineShow  the confirmation hearings are political theater. They make no difference at all. The GOP has the votes. @ValentineShow  if Obama will commute Manning's sentence do you think a pardon for Hillary is far behind? @ValentineShow Bradley Manning can call himself whatever he likes. He's still a bitch. @RobSchneider is right. That's why he's catching so much butthurt from the lib media & the perpetually aggrieved.  https://t.co/N7qMouXPlB I think @repjohnlewis is right.

Get real. Obama will pardon her. She'll never even be investigated. Trump vows ‘insurance for everybody’ in Obamacare replacement plan.  This sounds familiar somehow.   https://t.co/2UjbFnW1TT

Strength is when you have so much to cry for but you prefer to smile instead. 💪🏾💪🏾 Let your smile change the world but never let the world change your smile. Sometimes you have to lose the battle to win the war. When love is real  it finds a way. I'm strong because I know my weaknesses. I'm wise because I've been foolish. I laugh because I've known sadness. Sometimes it takes sadness to know happiness  noise to appreciate silence and absence to value presence. Everyone deserves second chances  but not for the same mistake. If you're lucky enough to get a second chance  do not waste it. 🎯🎯🎯 You'll never live a happy life if you always care about what others think about you. The past is your lesson. The present is your gift. The future is your motivation. Stop being afraid of what could go wrong and think of what could go right. "The best revenge is massive success." — Frank Sinatra

"гораздо" слово было. я  видимо  то ли две  то ли горадо больше версий видел второй части "назад в будущее-2". еле-еле отличающихся. которая качается при этом пока  третья часть. а второй фильм в этой версии страшновато пока смотреть  я прощёлкал просто. это уже не знаю  кто ворвался и  видимо  прекратил "назад в будущее-2" раздавать связав странную версию второго фильма с третьей частью типа подарка было  так-то я уверен  что он - мразь. М.М. я-то обещал не делать  но то на новый год ещё было на котором то же самое почти что у меня ах да  и постарался  сломать вашему иисусу компьютер  когда выключал после лукашенко-сюсько. "жёсткий диск" то есть его сломать хотел. та раньше приебала  я проигнорил уже. вместе с некоторыми из вас  и Ирой Бураго в виде мамы. неудачная была затея идти чай делать  пока поставил "назад в будущее-3" перекачивать. лукашенко-сюсько  видимо  ворвался и выключил.

Ability without instruction leads fatal casualties and calamities! What grieves you is a proof of your calling in such an area. God do not invest in people for nothing! Is there not a cause? Its for a cause! Its for a purpose! Embrace the oil on and the wisdom in your own life! There's room for your one-talent! Embrace it with pride and attitude! Stay in your calling. You DO NOT have to be a PROPHET to succeed in ministry! Use your influence to open doors for others! What is power if its hoarded to ones own drowning! Some people do not need prayers.

2218376174,sileaswarwick,0,Nothing is more attractive than seeing someone who lives entirely in the present moment. I understand. I just don't care. Music is actually more effective at battling depression than counseling is. I'm a teenager why does my back hurt I'm not 70 years old If you think it's "gay" to do nice things for a girl you're probably too immature for a relationship anyway. Confidence and success go hand in hand. Keep a piece of paper and pencil by your bed. Everyone always gets their best ideas at night! Male-looking robots are called Androids female-looking robots are called Gynoids. IMAGINE IF SIMON COWELL WAS YOUR DAD AND YOU WERE SINGING IN THE SHOWER AND HE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR AND SAID "IT'S A NO FROM ME". Short women have a healthy advantage over women taller in height. They also live longer. Soda has the same effect on tooth enamel as Meth and Crack cocaine. I get progressively uglier throughout the day There is a company that will turn your cremated ashes into a diamond which can be used by your loved ones. johanna mason literally said "fuck you" to president snow but he's like "oh shit katniss done made herself a bird" Tobacco smoke contains over 4 000 chemicals  including at least 50 of that cause  initiate or promote cancer. true embarrassment lies within your first email address. i've grown so unattached from people like i could move across the country and not give a shit about leaving anyone expect for like 3 people If I text a person in the same room as me  I stare at them till they get it. cause of death: too shy to call ambulance Stop scrolling  you need sleep ?

I figured there would be an agreement w NO but it seems like things have hit a road block @BenVolin I think it's perfectly reasonable to suggest that someone with literally zero experience might not be doing a great job. @JumboHart that's a big if at this point unfortunately. Losing him wouldn't make it bad  but it would make it much more of a question mark. @Eric_Edholm @DougKyed no no no we better not give up a top corner for a 2nd round pick @JumboHart ugh I don't get why we are replacing our SB winning players with more expensive substitutes that might not be as good. @JumboHart @KevinRDuffy i will be so pissed if we effectively end up trading 3rd and MB for Cooks. MB is much more valuable than a receiver @JumboHart Why would Pats trade for anything less than #11? If they want him they need to give up #11 if not we should keep him! @MikeReiss @brettmartel Pats would get number 11 because that is Saints original pick @KevinRDuffy oh yeah fair point. Even then tho  if they go lower on $$$ it would be weird if MB signed cuz he said he wants elite money. @KevinRDuffy if they wouldn't offer two similarly skilled corners that money  why would they give that $ AND give up 1st pick for MB @KevinRDuffy the reason why I think this wouldn't happen is cuz GB could have offered the contract MB wants to Gilmore or Bouye but didn't

Senyum tak selalu berarti seseorang bahagia. Kadang seseorang tersenyum hanya karena tak ingin menjelaskan kenapa hatinya terluka. Cinta itu ibarat bara api  dia menghangatkan hatimu jika diungkapkan dgn Tulus. Jika tidak  dia akan menghanguskanmu. Hidup tak bisa jadi lebih baik tanpa cinta  tapi cinta dengan cara yang salah membuat hidup jadi lebih buruk. Mungkin Aku lahir kedunia untuk mencintaimu  dan kau terlahir untuk aku cintai. Berada dipelukanmu itu mengajarkanku apa arti kenyamanan yang sempurna :) Sulit tuk ucapkan selamat tinggal pada dia yang kamu cinta  tapi lebih sulit lagi ketika kenangan bersamanya tak hilang begitu saja. Seseorang yang berarti  tak akan dengan mudah kamu miliki. Jika kamu sungguh mencintai  jangan pernah berhenti berusaha untuk hati.

K네 반은 9시  우리 반은 10시라서 9시~9시 10분까지 쉬는 시간인데 그 때 K가 심심하다고 반에 올라와서 내 얼굴 보고 갔다. 그 사소한 행동이 얼마나 맘 간지럽히는지 알까. 안 자길 잘 했다 RT @iyangmal: 15분 골반 교정 요가 http://t.co/yalLsKj2np 이거 효과 진짜입니다 4일째 하고있는데 지난 18년간의 내 허리는 돌멩이였구나 깨달음 진심 거의 24시간 내내 허리 똑바로 펴고 다니는데도 하나도 안 뻐근함 요새 K가 바빠서 잘 못 보고 있습니다... 다들 안녕히.
